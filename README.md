# back-end-dicoding-submission

##this is my first back end code\
just copy to your machine\
then put\
```npm install``` on terminal working directory\
wait until finished then just\
```npm start``` or ```node server.js``` on terminal working directory\
\
if you want to run it on container\
just do \
```docker-compose up -d```\
